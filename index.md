## Nils E-Portfolio

Welcome to my e-portfolio which I use while studying cyber security at the University of Essex Online.



### About Me


```markdown
My name is Nils and I'm from Düssseldorf, Germany. I have an academic background in Business and Management with an BS and MSc. degree. However, I'm working as an IT-consultant 
for 5 years now with focus on project management and cloud transistion. I have several cloud architecture certification and the CSA CCSK.
The CCSK is what got me intrested in cyber security in the first place and I hope I'll learn much more in this course to better serve my customers and secure their systems.
